And until the election is clearly decided in the minds -- where the Electoral College votes, they get put in a very tough position,&quot; he added. </p><p>Asked if he thinks more GOP senators will publicly recognize his win after the Electoral College votes on December 14, Biden replied: &quot;At least a significant portion of the leadership.&quot; </p><p>Biden, who served in the Senate for decades before being elected vice president in 2008, said he doesn&#x27;t know if that will change across the board, noting that many of the senators he served with are no longer in office. </p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s not the same Senate personnel that I knew when I left the Senate. There are only about 35 -- or 30%, 40% that are there when I was in the Senate,&quot; he said. </p><p>As President Donald Trump has continued to push baseless claims of voter fraud in the weeks following the election, the President&#x27;s Republican allies have been largely silent on Biden&#x27;s win. Chief among them is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said last month that Trump is within his rights to make his case in court. </p><p>CNN previously reported that Democratic Sen. Chris Coons said some Republican senators had been privately asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf.</p><p>&quot;They call me to say, you know, &#x27;Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can&#x27;t say that publicly yet,&#x27;&quot; Coons told CNN&#x27;s Alisyn Camerota on &quot;New Day.&quot; </p></div></div><hr/><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>Â© 2019 Cable News Network.
