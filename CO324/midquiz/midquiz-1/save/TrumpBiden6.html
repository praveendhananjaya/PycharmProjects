In light of the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, Wolf issued a memo in July saying that new applications for DACA would not be accepted and renewals would be limited to one year instead of two amid an ongoing review. The memo had sought to buy time while the administration decided its next steps.</p><p>Garaufis&#x27; Friday order appears to nod to the administration&#x27;s handling of the Supreme Court ruling, calling the Department of Homeland Security to publicly -- and prominently -- provide notice that it will accept new applications and return to two-year renewals. </p><p>&quot;DHS is DIRECTED to post a public notice, within 3 calendar days of this Order, to be displayed prominently on its website and on the websites of all other relevant agencies, that it is accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under DACA, renewal requests, and advance parole requests, based on the terms of the DACA program prior to September 5, 2017, and in accordance with this court&#x27;s Memorandum &amp; Order of November 14, 2020,&quot; Garaufis wrote. </p><p>Garaufis also again slammed Wolf&#x27;s appointment, which has repeatedly come under scrutiny. </p><p>The Department of Homeland Security tried to self-correct its line of succession by having Pete Gaynor, who is the Senate-confirmed Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, temporarily exercise the authority of Homeland Security secretary to try to alleviate concerns over Wolf&#x27;s legitimacy as acting chief of the department. </p><p>&quot;Neither Administrator Gaynor nor Mr. Wolf currently possesses, nor have they ever possessed, the powers of the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security,&quot; Garaufis wrote in a footnote. </p><p>Garaufis ordered that Wolf&#x27;s memo detailing new DACA rules be vacated.</p></div></div><hr/><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>Â© 2019 Cable News Network.
