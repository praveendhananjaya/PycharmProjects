Pentagon blocked Biden's intelligence transition team from meeting with agencies
Updated 9:49 PM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
(CNN) - The Trump administration prevented President-elect Joe Biden's transition team from meeting with its counterparts at Pentagon intelligence agencies this week, according to a former senior intelligence official familiar with intelligence transition discussions.
The slowdown means the Biden team has not yet been able to meet with officials from the military intelligence agencies within the Defense Department -- including the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency -- even as all other meetings by Biden review teams appear to be happening smoothly now after weeks of delay.
The Pentagon denies any effort to stymie the President-elect's team. A senior defense official told CNN that briefings had taken place on Friday for transition officials on military matters, including senior-level policy and international security issues, but not on intelligence. 
The Washington Post first reported on the Biden team's problems with the Defense Department transition office, which is led by a Trump loyalist connected to efforts to spread conspiracy theories about the President-elect.
The delays come even as the General Services Administration gave a green light on November 23 for officials at federal agencies across the government to meet with the President-elect's Agency Review Teams -- essential to ensuring a smooth transfer of power. 
Last week, arrangements were made for Biden's Agency Review Team to meet with the various defense intelligence agencies this week, the former intelligence official said. 
But early in the week, word came from the Pentagon that the Biden team would have no engagement with defense intelligence agencies until it had submitted questions in advance and listed the names of the people with whom it wanted to interact. 
At that point, the Biden team's requests would be reviewed by the Defense Department's general counsel and Kash Patel, the Trump loyalist appointed to lead the Pentagon's transition last month amid President Donald Trump's purge of civilian leadership at the department.
"That's a big FU from Defense to the incoming intelligence community transition team," the former official said.
Sue Gough, a Defense Department spokesperson, denied there has been any issue with the Biden teams' ability to meet with intelligence officials at the Pentagon.
"The DOD Agency Review Team has not been denied any access," Gough said in a statement. "We continue to work with the DOD ART to schedule all requested interviews, briefings and updates."
Biden transition team spokesman Ned Price declined to comment. The National Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
A defense official said the Biden transition team for intelligence had "made direct coordination with DOD intelligence agencies for interviews, briefings and site visits," and the Pentagon had then asked that it reach out to Patel for all of its requests for interviews and site visits "per the statute, GSA guidance" and the memorandum of understanding between the White House and the President-elect.
"In case that isn't clear," the defense official said, "the schedule change/delay happened because the (Biden team) didn't reach out to DOD before scheduling a meeting with DOD agencies, PER THE GUIDANCE and MOU. They weren't denied, they just had to follow the proper procedure."
Gough said in her statement that visits were "tentatively scheduled for early next week," and that Patel and the acting under secretary of defense for intelligence and security are working closely with others "and are completing coordination" for the Biden teams to visit.
The Defense Department's stand on the issue has angered Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, according to the former intelligence official, who said Ratcliffe intended to take the issue to the White House. 
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created to coordinate efforts among the intelligence agencies across the administration.
"Ratcliffe was hot. He saw it as insubordination," the former intelligence official said. "It was his authority as DNI to set the stage for and processes of the transition." 
Vince Stewart, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and former deputy director of US Cyber Command who now co-leads Biden's intelligence transition team, visited the Office of the Director of National Intelligence this week to lay the groundwork for a visit by Biden's pick to replace Ratcliffe, Avril Haines.
Trump appointed Patel and Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the acting under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, to their posts as part of a slew of major changes at the Pentagon, where he has jettisoned much of the civilian leadership in recent weeks, replacing them with political loyalists as his administration winds to a close.
Cohen-Watnick gained notoriety in March 2017 for his alleged involvement in providing intelligence materials to then-House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, a California Republican who went on to claim that US intelligence officials improperly surveilled Trump associates.
Since firing Defense Secretary Mark Esper by tweet November 9, the President has ousted at least three other top officials and replaced them with perceived loyalists. Trump has also replaced the members on two advisory boards, installing his former campaign manager on one of them.

Courts across the country hand Trump and his allies more losses as attempts to upend election results collapse
Updated 10:23 PM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
(CNN) - The Trump campaign and its allies were dealt additional blows in Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin and Arizona on Friday as courts rejected their attempts to challenge the presidential election results.  
The quartet of decisions are the latest losses in court for President Donald Trump's campaign and his backers as they try to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's election win last month. Dozens of lawsuits have been dismissed at the state and federal levels in states across the country since the push to overturn the vote began in November.
Trump has yet to concede the race, though he has alluded on occasion to no longer being in office next year.
Michigan
In Michigan, judges from the state's Court of Claims ruled 2-1 against the Trump campaign, saying its request to challenge election results is "moot" because the State Board of Canvassers has already certified the results. The judges added that the campaign missed its window to call for a recount, which was the only legal remedy it could have pursued.
The court criticized the campaign for not correcting issues with its initial November 6 filing until 11:21 p.m. on November 30. The Wayne County Board of Canvassers certified the results of its election on November 17, and the State Board of Canvassers certified the election on November 23. 
"Because plaintiff failed to follow the clear law in Michigan relative to such matters, their action is moot," the judges wrote.
Biden won the state by more than 154,000 votes, and there has been no evidence of fraud in the election. 
Every court case filed by Trump or his orbit in Michigan has been lost or withdrawn. Rudy Giuliani took his parade of misinformation and false claims about the election to the Michigan House Oversight Committee earlier this week, where he did not testify under oath and brought forward witnesses who made recycled, previously disproven claims about the election. 
Nevada
District Judge James Russell rejected a Republican attempt to declare Trump the winner of Nevada's electoral votes.
One day after a lengthy evidentiary hearing, Russell wrote that "contestant did not prove under any standard of proof" a long list of accusations against the Biden-Harris campaign, including paying voters to cast ballots. He denied the request to replace Democratic electors with Republican ones.
"While we appreciate the court's consideration of evidence submitted, we disagree with the dismissal of the contest," a Nevada Republican Party spokesperson said in a statement. "The case and evidence we presented was compelling and overwhelming. President Donald J. Trump's Nevada Elector's will immediately appeal this denial to the Nevada Supreme Court. The fight continues for clean and fair elections."
Arizona
A state court late Friday dismissed a lawsuit seeking to either void Biden's win in Arizona or force another recount.
In a brief order, State Superior Court Judge Randall Warren said the plaintiffs had failed to prove fraud, misconduct, illegal votes or an erroneous count.  
The plaintiff -- Kelli Ward, the state's Republican Party chair and a Trump presidential elector -- said before Warren's ruling that she would appeal any adverse outcome to the Arizona Supreme Court. This is the fifth election-related suit brought by Trump allies to be dismissed or dropped in state court in Arizona since the election.
In recent weeks, Ward has relentlessly promoted a wide range of baseless election conspiracy theories on social media and in public statements. Her suit, filed against the 11 Biden electors, alleged that errors in Maricopa County, the state's most populous and home to Phoenix, had cost Trump enough votes to potentially alter the result. The suit focused on alleged issues with verifying voters' signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes and claims that votes had been flipped in the duplication of ballots that couldn't be read by tabulation machines.
But during a two-day trial that included reexamining 1,626 duplicated or signature-verified mail-in ballots, officials found a total of nine errors that would have cost Trump a net of six votes. State elections officials and their attorneys said extrapolating that error rate to the 27,859 duplicated ballots in Maricopa County would potentially mean Trump could have lost roughly 100 votes -- nowhere near enough to make any difference, given that Biden won Arizona by a margin of 10,457 votes.
Seven GOP election observers raised allegations of machines or software flipping votes, or of other errors, in their testimony. But elections officials testified that the alleged errors largely would have been addressed during the process of verifying the votes.
Attorney Marc Elias, representing the Biden electors, argued that the plaintiffs provided "no evidence about misconduct, no evidence about fraud, no evidence about illegal votes." He said the "garden-variety errors" they described "don't come anywhere near showing the results should be overturned."
"Joe Biden won this election," Elias said. 'Nothing you heard over the last two days ... could plausibly change that."  
Wisconsin
For the second day in a row, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4-3 against a lawsuit attempting to invalidate the results of the state's presidential election.
The latest comes from the Wisconsin Voters Alliance alleging "material violations of Wisconsin law" by state elections officials and asking the court to prevent certification of the election by the Wisconsin Elections Commission so the "state legislature can lawfully appoint the electors."
As part of the concurring opinion, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote they were being asked to perform an "unprecedented" task, opining, "We are invited to invalidate the entire presidential election in Wisconsin by declaring it 'null' -- yes, the whole thing. And there's more. We should, we are told, enjoin the Wisconsin Elections Commission from certifying the election so that Wisconsin's presidential electors can be chosen by the legislature instead, and then compel the Governor to certify those electors." 
He continued, "Once the door is opened to judicial invalidation of presidential election results, it will be awfully hard to close that door again. This is a dangerous path we are being asked to tread. The loss of public trust in our constitutional order resulting from the exercise of this kind of judicial power would be incalculable."
Chief Justice Patience Roggensack dissented, writing, "This is the third time that a majority of this court has turned its back on pleas from the public to address a matter of statewide concern that requires a declaration of what the statutes require for absentee voting."
On Thursday, the court had declined to hear a lawsuit filed by Trump seeking to remove more than 221,000 votes from Wisconsin's certified presidential election vote total.
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, certified the results of the presidential election on November 30, granting Biden the state's 10 electoral votes.

White House exodus begins even as Trump continues to baselessly claim victory
Updated 6:21 PM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
(CNN) - White House staffers at all levels are plotting their departures as a growing number of aides to President Donald Trump are abandoning his quest to overturn the 2020 election results -- some in frustration with the building they are leaving behind.
Multiple sources inside and outside the White House cited a variety of reasons for the exodus already underway, ranging from the urgent need for employment to a palpable disgust with Trump's ill-fated election challenges. 
One source familiar with the situation said Trump's refusal to accept defeat has unnerved some staffers who worry the President is tarnishing his own legacy and, more critically, eroding voters' faith in US elections. Others have said they understood the odds were high that they'd need to find new jobs soon, and they prepared to make career moves regardless of how the President reacted to defeat. 
A separate senior administration official described a "toxic" work environment among the dwindling number of West Wing staffers. While the Trump White House was never the model of a functional workplace, the lack of direction and sense of defeat during Trump's lame duck period has sharpened divides among staffers facing the prospect of potential unemployment. 
"I think people are moving on because they have families or livelihoods to support," the official said.
"That, and the place is becoming more toxic by the day ... people turning on each other, trying to settle scores while they can," the official added.
The White House did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.
White House communications director Alyssa Farah, a close ally of chief of staff Mark Meadows, announced Thursday that she would step down from her position. Her departure was seen by people close to the White House as a signal that leaving the administration is no longer viewed a betrayal of the President.
"A great person who did a fantastic job. Thank you, Alyssa!" Trump tweeted on Friday.
One White House adviser, who is in the process of interviewing some departing administration staffers, said there is a growing acceptance that there will not be a second Trump administration, at least not beginning on January 20, 2021. 
"Some are moving on," the White House adviser said. "It's time."
The adviser said it is understandable that aides have become irritated with Trump's stubbornness. But the adviser noted they signed on to work for Trump.
"No one expects him to concede. No one!" the adviser said.
Mass staff exits from administrations occur at the end of every presidency, whether that comes after two terms or at the end of one that is cut short by an election loss. But Trump's refusal to concede the race and acknowledge the coming change has forced top staffers -- some of them longtime loyalists -- into a deeply uncomfortable position with just weeks to go before their paychecks stop arriving. 
After John McEntee, head of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, issued a warning to administration staffers that any caught looking for a job could be fired -- a warning that leaked to the press and was widely reported last month -- many political aides across the federal government continued to search for their next move unfazed. 
But some younger, more junior appointees were indeed spooked by the warning -- a situation some more senior aides found regrettable given the additional difficulty those staffers may have finding work.
One senior administration official described the current scramble for Capitol Hill jobs among Trump administration aides as a game of "musical chairs," noting the "music" will essentially stop in January and many aides will be left without a "chair" after the limited number of open positions are filled heading into the new Congress. Republicans gained 13 seats in the House but flipped only one Senate seat; they lost two GOP Senate spots and could potentially lose two more depending on the outcome of the Georgia runoffs.  
Beyond Capitol Hill, some aides are considering private sector or think tank jobs -- in some cases competing against their colleagues for the same openings. 
While many White House and administration officials quietly began their job hunt in the days after the election without sharing their plans in the office, many are openly discussing their prospects now and leaving when they land somewhere -- even though Trump's refusal to acknowledge the looming end of his presidency remains unchanged from early November.

Trump's criticism of GOP Senate candidates has Republicans worried ahead of rally
Updated 5:53 PM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
(CNN) - President Donald Trump heads to Georgia on Saturday to campaign for two Republican senators one month ahead of a critical runoff that will determine which party controls the Senate. But Trump's visit comes as he has spent the last several weeks consumed by his own election loss while attacking party officials in the state, casting doubt on its voting process and questioning one of the lawmakers he's urging voters to elect.
According to two sources, during a recent phone call Trump blasted Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp as a "moron" and "nut job" and asked why Sen. Kelly Loeffler did not secure a majority of votes on Election Day, placing her in a runoff against the Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Last December, Trump had lobbied Kemp to fill the seat vacated by Johnny Isakson with Doug Collins, not Loeffler, but Kemp appointed Loeffler anyway -- a factor Trump has harped on in recent days. 
Trump's private and public broadsides have raised concerns among Republicans that his interference could do more harm than good in the pivotal races. 
If Democrats can win both races, it will dramatically change the trajectory of the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency. It would make the Senate a 50-50 tie between the two caucuses, allowing Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the deciding vote -- giving him much greater leeway in naming his Cabinet and confirming judges. But if the Republicans pick off just one of the seats, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will retain control of the chamber, forcing Democrats into a much more compromising position.
But Trump's impending campaign rally in Georgia has some Republicans on edge, concerned Trump could depress turnout among his base if he continues to rail against Georgia's election system and launches more attacks against Kemp.
"It's not helpful if he goes down there and attacks the governor for an hour and a half. But really, what needs to happen is he needs to say a couple things -- the right things -- that will be loaded into a teleprompter and that we can cut up and use for TV," a Trump adviser said. "If he says the few things that we need him to say, it'll be helpful."
Despite his popularity with Republicans, Trump was reluctant to campaign in Georgia and grudgingly agreed to visit one month before the critical race after being lobbied by several allies, according to multiple sources. 
Perdue and Loeffler both called Trump before Thanksgiving, urging him to come campaign in their state ahead of the runoff, a Republican familiar with the conversation said.
Others, such as Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, have also encouraged Trump to campaign in Georgia, plying him with the prospect that he can take credit for a Loeffler and Perdue victory in January if he campaigns in the Peach State.
Trump will hold a rally at an airport hangar in Valdosta, Georgia on Saturday following a visit by Vice President Mike Pence to the state Friday. Kemp, who Trump called "hapless" this week, had been scheduled to meet Pence on the tarmac but canceled at the last minute over a "family emergency." It's not clear if he will meet Trump on the tarmac Saturday.
Several sources who have spoken with Trump in recent days described a President more obsessed with his own election loss than preserving the power of Republicans in the Senate, despite how many members of his party have privately expressed a desire to put the 2020 election behind them and focus on the Georgia runoff. 
Trump taped a 46-minute video this week that was mainly filled with recycled grievances and lies about the election, despite his own attorney general stating this week that the Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of voter fraud that would change the election outcome. Trump questioned how Republicans could have fared so well in the 2020 race while he lost.
"It is statistically impossible that the person, me, that led the charge lost," Trump falsely claimed in the video.
Trump's rally is being funded by the RNC instead of his campaign, which usually foots the bill, but not because of a lack of cash. In the last month, Trump's campaign has inundated supporters with fundraising appeals over his baseless claims the election was rigged. Refusing to concede the White House race has proved to be a lucrative endeavor for the President, given his political operation has raised more than $207 million since Election Day. 
Asked about Trump's reluctance to travel to the state, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CNN: "Control of the US Senate is on the line in Georgia's two runoff elections and the President knows it's imperative that Sen. Perdue and Sen. Loeffler are successful. The President is going to Georgia to rally Republicans and remind them what's at stake."
CNN reported this week that Georgia Republicans are increasingly worried about Trump's rally as some brace for a tirade to overturn his loss that could hurt the party's effort to keep control of the chamber. A group of prominent former Georgia Republican officials, including former Gov. Nathan Deal and former Sens. Isakson and Saxby Chambliss, released a statement on Wednesday urging the party to unify and to shift attention to the challenge of protecting their Senate majority.
When asked if he thought the President would change his tune on Saturday, Chambliss told CNN that he does not predict what Trump will do. "And that's part of the concern that I have," he said.
"I want him coming down here talking about Kelly and David, and how important they are to the future of the country, and how their election is so critical to his legacy," said the former senator. "If he wants his legacy to remain, then he needs to ensure that we win both these seats -- and he needs to say that in no uncertain terms."
Trump's team and the RNC have been coordinating with the Perdue and Loeffler campaigns to get out the vote in Georgia. Donald Trump Jr. has made it clear that his father's supporters need to back the GOP ticket. Trump Jr. is starring in a series of ads that will air on conservative media outlets designed to get out the Trump vote.

Hispanic caucus expresses frustration to Biden team with how Michelle Lujan Grisham has been treated
Updated 8:46 AM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
Washington  (CNN) - Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus expressed frustration in a meeting with leaders of President-elect Joe Biden's transition team on Thursday with how they believe New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has been treated in the Cabinet selection process. 
They took particular issue with what they say were leaks from the transition team about Lujan Grisham turning down a Cabinet position to lead the Department of Interior, saying that the leaks had the effect of being embarrassing for the governor. 
Members of the caucus have been pushing Biden to name Lujan Grisham, the first Democratic Latina to be elected governor in the United States, as his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. The push is part of a broader effort to pressure Biden to name multiple Latino or Latina nominees to top posts in his administration. The group also wants California Attorney General Xavier Becerra or Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez to serve as US attorney general.
Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona told CNN, that in the meeting, members expressed their frustration, hurt and disappointment about Lujan Grisham's treatment. The meeting was held virtually with incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain, as well as key Biden transition team leaders Jeffrey Zients and Ted Kaufman. 
Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, a member from New Mexico, spoke up first, according to Grijalva, but was followed by a chorus of members in the CHC about the harm it had done to Lujan Grisham's reputation and other women who had been interested in positions in Biden's Cabinet.
"You can't be cavalier with this stuff. Their reputations are on the line and when something comes up like, 'We offered her something and she didn't take it,'Â it puts a bad light on her and on other candidates," Grijalva said. 
Grijalva said that members were also frustrated that it had hurt Rep. Deb Haaland, a Democrat from New Mexico, who had expressed an interest in the top job at Interior.
"Most of us interpreted it as a slap in both their faces," Grijalva said. He added that Klain "shared both the concern and sometimes the anger that members were expressing."
"He said it was regrettable and that it was not the way we should do things," Grijalva said of Klain. 
A source on the call with the members and the Biden transition team described it as "diplomatic but tense." The source said Klain was very respectful and told the group they were right, but that he couldn't control what leaks came out of the transition team.
The Biden transition team declined to comment to CNN on the meeting.  
The chairman of the caucus, Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas, said in a statement that the meeting was "productive and positive." He said a number of topics were discussed, "including an equitable economic recovery, prioritizing immigration reforms, and the disproportionate harm of COVID-19 on Latino communities." 
"Members reiterated the importance of Latino and Latina representation in the incoming Biden-Harris administration, particularly in the Cabinet," his statement reads. "We look forward to working in partnership with President-Elect Biden to assemble the most diverse administration in American history and to build back better."
CNN has reached out to Lujan Grisham's office for comment. 
Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told CNN that in the meeting she brought up the fact that there had yet to be a single Latina named to the Cabinet, and said the information about Lujan Grisham turning down the post at Interior going public seemed like an attempt to discredit a very qualified woman.
"As someone who read the articles ... the way it read was someone was trying to send a message that she had her shot and she walked away," the member said. "I don't even know that is true. It is distressing. She is the consummate professional. She is someone we are so proud of. She is someone who is imminently qualified."
Lujan Grisham previously served three terms in Congress and chaired the Hispanic caucus. She was on Biden's short list to be his running mate, and currently serves as a co-chair of Biden's transition team. 
This week, 32 members of Congress, including Castro, signed a letter to the Biden transition team lobbying for Lujan Grisham's nomination as HHS secretary. In addition to congressional and governing experience, Lujan Grisham would come to the role with health care credentials after serving as the health secretary of New Mexico from 2003 to 2007.
Biden is under increasing pressure to appoint Black and Latino nominees to remaining high-level Cabinet positions. 
So far, the President-elect has named to his Cabinet UN Ambassador nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a Black woman, Secretary of Homeland Security nominee Alejandro Mayorkas, a Cuban American man who would be the first Latino to serve in the position if confirmed by the Senate, and Neera Tanden, who is the first woman of color and first South Asian person nominated to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Cecilia Rouse is also the first woman of color nominated to serve as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Biden said last week he would elevate that role to the Cabinet level.

Biden on nominating diverse Cabinet: 'I'm going to keep my commitment'
Updated 10:37 PM ET, Thu December 3, 2020
(CNN) - Joe Biden said Thursday he would keep his commitment to nominate a Cabinet that reflects America's diversity, as the President-elect faces increasing pressure to appoint Black and Latino nominees to remaining high-level Cabinet positions. 
"I'm going to keep my commitment that the administration, both in the White House and outside in the Cabinet, is going to look like the country," Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper in a joint interview with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. 
The President-elect noted the group of nominees he has named so far constitutes "the most diverse Cabinet anyone in American history has ever announced." Harris will also make history as the first woman, first Black person and first person of South Asian descent to become Vice President. 
Biden said he had a meeting scheduled with the NAACP on Tuesday. NAACP President Derrick Johnson told CNN Wednesday that his organization and other civil rights groups had requested time with Biden and Harris to discuss the incoming administration and ensuring minority and civil rights representation in their agenda. 
"Their job is to push me," Biden said, noting every advocacy group is "pushing for more and more and more of what they want. That's their job."
"My job is to keep my commitment to make the decisions," Biden said. "And when it's all over people will take a look and say, I promise you, you'll see the most diverse Cabinet representative of all folks, Asian Americans, African Americans, Latinos, LGBTQ, across the board."
Biden said the rest of his Cabinet nominees would be announced "in the next month or so."
Biden has so far named four people with diverse backgrounds to his Cabinet: UN Ambassador nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a Black woman; Secretary of Homeland Security nominee Alejandro Mayorkas, a Cuban American man who would be the first Latino to serve in the position if confirmed by the Senate; Neera Tanden, who is the first woman of color and first South Asian person nominated to lead the Office of Management and Budget; and Cecilia Rouse, who will be the first woman of color nominated to serve as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, a position Biden said last week he would elevate to the Cabinet level.
Biden has also announced several other historic firsts to other positions in his administration, including Wally Adeyemo, who would be the first Black person to serve as Treasury deputy secretary. 
But some elected officials, activists and civil rights groups have lamented Biden has not done enough to diversify his Cabinet. 
Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have requested Biden appoint either California Attorney General Xavier Becerra or Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez to serve as the US attorney general.Â Members of the CHC are also lobbying for New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to be nominated for the role of health and human services secretary.
South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, an influential member of Democratic leadership, has said that Biden team needs to continue appointing more Black men and women to top administration posts.Â Clyburn's endorsement helped Biden win the South Carolina primary, which revived his campaign and put him on the path to win the Democratic nomination. 
Clyburn said Wednesday, "I can think of at least 10 Black folks that qualify for every single one," of the Cabinet nominees Biden has named. Clyburn has been pushing for Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge to lead the Department of Agriculture.

Trump administration must accept new DACA applications, judge orders
Updated 6:38 PM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
(CNN) - The Trump administration must post a public notice that it will accept new applications for the Obama-era program shielding undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation, a federal judge ordered Friday. 
Judge Nicholas Garaufis' latest order builds on his November ruling where he found that Chad Wolf was not legally serving as acting Homeland Security secretary when he signed rules limiting applications and renewals for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. 
The Trump administration tried ending DACA in 2017, but the US Supreme Court blocked its attempt in June. In light of the Supreme Court's ruling, Wolf issued a memo in July saying that new applications for DACA would not be accepted and renewals would be limited to one year instead of two amid an ongoing review. The memo had sought to buy time while the administration decided its next steps.
Garaufis' Friday order appears to nod to the administration's handling of the Supreme Court ruling, calling the Department of Homeland Security to publicly -- and prominently -- provide notice that it will accept new applications and return to two-year renewals. 
"DHS is DIRECTED to post a public notice, within 3 calendar days of this Order, to be displayed prominently on its website and on the websites of all other relevant agencies, that it is accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under DACA, renewal requests, and advance parole requests, based on the terms of the DACA program prior to September 5, 2017, and in accordance with this court's Memorandum & Order of November 14, 2020," Garaufis wrote. 
Garaufis also again slammed Wolf's appointment, which has repeatedly come under scrutiny. 
The Department of Homeland Security tried to self-correct its line of succession by having Pete Gaynor, who is the Senate-confirmed Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, temporarily exercise the authority of Homeland Security secretary to try to alleviate concerns over Wolf's legitimacy as acting chief of the department. 
"Neither Administrator Gaynor nor Mr. Wolf currently possesses, nor have they ever possessed, the powers of the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security," Garaufis wrote in a footnote. 
Garaufis ordered that Wolf's memo detailing new DACA rules be vacated.

They sued Trump. Then they walked 230 miles for their day in court
Updated 2:30 PM ET, Tue November 12, 2019
(CNN) - Eliana FernÃ¡ndez has blisters on her feet and her legs ache. She walked for more than two weeks and trekked 230 miles to get here.
Her destination: the US Supreme Court, where justices heard arguments Tuesday that could decide her fate and shape the lives of hundreds of thousands of people across the United States.
FernÃ¡ndez, 31, is one of the plaintiffs suing the government over the Trump administration's decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The Obama-era program provides deportation protection and work permits to around 700,000 young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.
The Trump administration has argued the executive action that created the program was an overreach of authority.
So far, a series of lower court orders have blocked the administration's efforts to terminate DACA, giving those who benefit a reprieve but also leaving their lives in a fragile limbo. 
Now, after years of uncertainty and political stalemates, this could be the make-or-break moment for many so-called Dreamers and the program that protects them. If justices uphold the administration's decision to end the program, those who were shielded by DACA for years could lose their work permits and become vulnerable to deportation.
"I hope they rule on the right side of history," FernÃ¡ndez told reporters after arguments concluded Tuesday.
There are far easier ways to get from New York to Washington. But FernÃ¡ndez says she walked -- and spoke out as much as she could along the way -- to make sure Supreme Court justices and members of the public know how much this matters.
She didn't march alone. About two dozen others walked beside her throughout the demonstration that began in New York City on October 26, and the group's ranks grew as they neared the nation's capital. 
Their message as they marched -- shouted through megaphones, chanted at rallies and written on signs and T-shirts: "Home is here." 
"Our lives are at stake," says FernÃ¡ndez, a lead organizer for the Make the Road New York advocacy group who was brought to the United States from Ecuador when she was a teenager. "I hope they can see that. I hope they can see our humanity, and that we matter, and we exist, and we have contributed to this country in so many ways.
"If they don't make the right decision, it could be devastating for thousands and thousands of families."
She's marching with her kids in mind
Organizers say the group covered 15-20 miles a day, often walking along rural highways. Marchers have passed through small towns and big cities along their route, documenting many steps of their journey on social media. 
Along the way, FernÃ¡ndez conducted video interviews with fellow participants, asking how they're feeling, why they're marching and what they've learned. She says she learned her own lessons, too -- about sticking together and taking action.
As she looked at the blisters forming on her feet after days on the road, FernÃ¡ndez said one thought crosses her mind.
"The physical pain will have no comparison to the pain that I will feel if somebody takes me away from my children," she says. "My biggest worry since the Trump administration took over was the fear of being separated from my kids."
She's been calling her 12-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son on FaceTime throughout the march. They've been home in New York, and it's hard to be apart from them. She missed trick-or-treating with them on Halloween this year. 
FernÃ¡ndez flips through pictures of her kids on her phone and calls them every morning before they go to school, every afternoon when they get home from school and every night before they go to sleep. She says she's marching for them.
"They are my everything, and they are the main reason why I became part of the lawsuit," she says. "It was the only way that I had to fight for my family, to fight for my kids."
She's afraid you've forgotten about DACA
Carolina Fung Feng, another plaintiff in one of the lawsuits over DACA who walked to Washington, fears many who aren't directly affected have forgotten about the program's plight. It's been frustrating, she says, to see people move on when she knows lives are still in peril. 
She's hoping to bring awareness back to the fight to save the program and other efforts to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation.
"For some people, it's not on their minds anymore because the program never terminated. ... We want to change that and tell them, 'No, you need to remember this and come out and support us again.'"
It is a reality Fung Feng, who was 12 years old when she came to the United States from Costa Rica, never forgets -- and one she thought of with each step she took on her way to Washington.
How at first she was scared to apply for DACA, worried about what the government would do with the data it was collecting.
How the day she got her Social Security card, she felt like she was finally being recognized as part of the United States.
How DACA gave her a chance to build a career as an educator.
How losing it would upend the life she's built and hurt the family she loves.
How she's fighting for others who don't have anything shielding them from deportation and are afraid to speak out.
"I wanted to stand up for myself and my community," she says, "because we have a lot to lose."
They've trudged through downpours and faced hecklers
Aside from the physical strain of a 16-day hike, another factor complicated matters for the marchers: stormy fall weather. 
By the second day of the march, torrential downpours left them soaked.
But FernÃ¡ndez and Fung Feng say they were amazed by the generosity people in communities they passed through showed to a group of strangers walking in the rain. 
One woman rushed out of her house with a poncho when she saw the group, and apologized she didn't have more to give.
Another offered to do everyone's laundry on a day when rains had drenched them.
Donors offered them warm meals. Churches gave them places to sleep at night. Supporters saw their signs and cheered or honked car horns in support.
Some responses to the marchers weren't positive, however.
Fung Feng says some passersby shouted things like, "I voted for Trump!" 
Once, just as a school bus was going by, a man shouted out, "No! You need to come here the right way!"
"That was a powerful moment," Fung Feng says.
Children on the bus, she says, were watching.
The group responded by chanting louder, linking arms and continuing forward with their march.

Biden urges America to mask up for 100 days as coronavirus surges
Updated 11:08 AM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
(CNN) - President John F. Kennedy urged Americans to ask not what their country could do for them, but what they could do for their country. When he takes the same oath of office next month, Joe Biden will effectively beseech the nation to do exactly the same thing, if in more prosaic terms, with an appeal for every American to wear a mask for his first, symbolic 100 days in office.
The President-elect revealed the galvanizing, altruistic, first national rallying call of his administration in an exclusive CNN interview on Thursday with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, previewing a sharp change of direction when he succeeds President Donald Trump.
"Just 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days. And I think we'll see a significant reduction," Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper, implicitly acknowledging that the coronavirus could be raging at even more intense levels when he takes office than its current alarming spike. 
Ever since President Franklin Roosevelt took office in the dark days of the Great Depression in 1933, the first 100 days have marked the apex of a new US leader's power and often the most prolific period for policy wins.
During the interview Thursday, Biden referenced the steep challenges Roosevelt confronted when he was first elected, noting that the current circumstances are "not unlike what happened in 1932."
"There was a fundamental change, not only taking place here in the United States, but around the world," Biden told Tapper. "We're in the middle of this fourth industrial revolution," he noted. With all the changes in technology, he said, Americans are wondering, "Will there be a middle class? What will people be doing? ... There's genuine, genuine anxiety."
FDR told Americans in his first inaugural address that "the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself," steeling a demoralized citizenry to hold firm amid a banking crisis that threatened to destroy an already devastated economy.
Biden will take office amid the most extreme domestic circumstances of any president since Roosevelt, with sickness and death rampant and millions of Americans unemployed, hungry or at risk of losing their homes.
Like his Democratic forbear, he will use the iconic opening moments of his term to summon an exhausted people to unite, in common cause -- with the help of new vaccines -- this time to beat the virus and save the economy. 
There is a question, however, whether Biden's calls for national unity will resonate among people who didn't vote for him after Trump's relentless attacks on the legitimacy of his victory in the presidential election. But Biden's call to action may carry greater urgency now that the virus is taking hold in rural areas of the heartland with comparatively rudimentary health care systems, which escaped the first wave of infection that concentrated in many cities that tend to vote for Democrats.
Biden's interview -- his first since the election that also included Harris -- underscored a complete course correction from Trump's attitude towards the virus. The pandemic has never been worse than it is now in the United States. One American is dying every 30 seconds amid record fatality figures and hospitalizations. Doctors and nurses are exhausted after months inside overflowing under-resourced Covid wards. 
More than 276,000 people have now died from coronavirus in the United States and the nation set a new record for hospitalizations on Thursday with more than 100,667 people being treated for Covid-19.
Yet the current President is ignoring the carnage, as he pursues his fantastical lies and claims the election that he lost by a comfortable margin was stolen.
Trump has frequently mocked the wearing of masks. He is holding holiday parties inside the White House in defiance of his own government's health recommendations. When he returned home after his bout in military hospital with Covid-19 he famously turned to the cameras and ripped off his mask.
By contrast, and if past behavior is any guide, it is conceivable that one of Biden's first acts after delivering his inaugural address in 47 days will be to put his mask back on.
Biden asks Fauci to stay in his current role
In another sign of a fresh approach to the pandemic, Biden said in the interview he had asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, who Trump has marginalized and insulted, to continue his current role as the nation's top infectious diseases specialist in Biden's administration and announced an effective promotion for the globally respected expert. Fauci told NBC on Friday that he immediately accepted.
"I asked him to stay on the exact same role he's had for the past several presidents, and I asked him to be a chief medical adviser for me as well, and be part of the Covid team," Biden told Tapper, in a gesture that implies a return to continuity and science based policy-making after Trump's wild presidency.
Biden emphasized that he and Fauci spoke about the fact that "you don't have to close down the economy" if Americans are following through with other safety protocols to prevent the spread of the virus. And he noted that even before they spoke, Fauci has been speaking regularly with Ron Klain, Biden's incoming chief of staff, and the two forged a close working relationship during the Ebola outbreak. The President-elect also said during the interview that he would get the vaccine publicly to show the public his confidence in it.
"When Dr. Fauci says we have a vaccine that is safe, that's the moment in which I will stand before the public and say that," Biden said. People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work. Already the numbers are really staggeringly low, and it matters what the president and vice president do." 
Earlier this week, former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all pledged to get the vaccine in public view to help combat vaccine skepticism. Biden said his three predecessors "have set the model as to what should be done."  
Aid to states and struggling Americans
The President-elect said it is already clear to him from his conversations with governors across the country, as well as 50 Democratic and Republican mayors, that they will need a significant amount of money to get the vaccine where it needs to go. 
"It's one thing to get the vaccine delivered -- in cases, some frozen, some not -- and another thing to get the vaccine to move from the case to a vaccination in someone's arm. That's the really complicated piece," Biden said, noting that governors and mayors told him they need far more financial assistance to get the vaccine delivered, which he described as "an incredibly expensive proposition."
"That's why we're continuing to hope that the Senate does something and responds to the immediate need to provide dollars. But we're going to need a lot more" once in office, Biden said. "It's going to cost literally billions of dollars to get this done. We can keep schools open. We can keep businesses open. But you have to be able to get the vaccine distributed."
The President-elect noted that the Trump administration has been "cooperating with us of late" and looping them in on the plans for how they are going to deliver on the vaccine, but he said, "There's not any help getting out there."
"Look at all the businesses that are being hurt so badly," he said. "No money to help them. Come Christmas time, there's going to be millions of people see their unemployment run out. So, there's a whole range of things that have to be done."
Biden called the $900 billion framework for a congressional aid package proposed by a bipartisan group of members "a good start," but said more aid would be needed and he urged members to focus on what struggling Americans need most.
"What's immediately needed is relief for people in their unemployment checks; relief for people who are going to get thrown out of their apartments after Christmas because they can't afford to pay the rent anymore; relief on mortgage payments; relief on all the things that are in the original bill the House passed," Biden said. "People are really hurting. They're scared to death."
Biden's diametrically different Covid strategy, particularly his call for Americans to mask up in the first 100 days, is already being welcomed by medical experts who are watching in horror as daily Covid deaths soar over 2,500 per day even before the feared escalation in infections following Thanksgiving travel.
"President-elect Biden, and his leadership and listening to scientists, believe that if we all wore our masks for 100 days, we would have a significant reduction in the transmission of the virus," said Rick Bright, a former Trump administration vaccine expert who resigned after warning the administration ignored warnings about the early spread of Covid-19.
"The science shows that wearing a face mask reduces the spread. I think it would have a huge impact," Bright, who now sits on Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
Hospitals in California were treating 2,066 patients with Covid-19 in intensive care units, breaking a record for the highest number of Covid cases since the start of the pandemic. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom warned that most regions of the state will soon cross the threshold he has set for a three-week stay-at-home order, which is triggered once ICU beds fall to 15% capacity in that region.  
Biden says Harris will be a full partner
While Biden and Harris had differences on an array of issues when she was running for president -- from their health care plans to her desire to see the Justice Department prosecute Trump after he leaves office -- she and Biden showed their policy alignment during the interview, which also offered some clues into her role and portfolio as vice president.
"We are full partners in this process," Harris said. 
Since the first day Biden asked her to join him on the ticket, she said he has been "very clear with me that he wants me to be the first and the last in the room" on major decisions. "So on every issue that impacts the American people, I will be a full partner to the President-elect and the President."
She mirrored Biden's position, for example, on how the administration would treat any potential investigations into Trump's conduct after he leaves office, even though it is different than the tone she used toward Trump during her campaign.
Biden told Tapper that his Justice Department will operate independently, and that he would not direct them on how or who to investigate: "I'm not going to be saying go prosecute A, B or C -- I'm not going to be telling them," Biden said. "That's not the role, it's not my Justice Department it's the people's Justice Department."
Harris, a former prosecutor who served as California's attorney general, echoed that call for independence for the Justice Department, drawing a bright line between the Biden administration's approach and Trump's.
"We will not tell the Justice Department how to do its job. And we are going to assume, and I say this as a former attorney general elected in California -- and I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States -- that any decision coming out of the Justice Department, in particular the United States Department of Justice, should be based on facts, it should be based on the law, it should not be influenced by politics, period," Harris told Tapper.
When Tapper asked Harris what her portfolio would be as vice president -- whether she would head a Covid-19 task force, for example, as Vice President Mike Pence has -- Biden interrupted to say he would answer the question. He said he planned to enlist Harris on whatever the most urgent need was at a given moment, much as he did for President Barack Obama as vice president.
"Whatever the most urgent need is that I'm not able to attend to, I have confidence in turning to her," Biden said, noting that was dissimilar from former Vice President Al Gore's approach, which was to handle an entire issue portfolio like the environment. "Look, there's not a single decision I've made yet about personnel or about how to proceed that I haven't discussed it with Kamala first."

CNN Exclusive: Biden says he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days he's in office
Updated 10:37 PM ET, Thu December 3, 2020
(CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday that he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office, in a sign of how Biden's approach to the virus will be dramatically different from President Donald Trump's response.
"Just 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days. And I think we'll see a significant reduction," Biden said for the first time in the interview with Tapper.
The wide-ranging conversation with Biden, his first joint interview with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris since winning the election, comes at a key time, as they build their administration and outline the policy priorities that will define their first year in office. And it comes as coronavirus cases and deaths have reached their highest levels to date, all while Trump is largely ignoring the dire moment and focusing almost exclusively on baselessly attacking the results of the election.
The coronavirus pandemic has dominated Biden's transition, and the former vice president acknowledged that it will do the same during his first year in office, telling CNN that he has asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of Trump's coronavirus task force, to be a chief medical adviser and part of his Covid-19 response team when his administration begins next month. 
Biden said the conversation happened on Thursday afternoon. CNN reported earlier in the day that Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had a planned meeting with Biden's transition team.
"I asked him to stay on the exact same role he's had for the past several presidents, and I asked him to be a chief medical adviser for me as well, and be part of the Covid team," Biden told Tapper.
In the interview, Biden said he supported Congress passing a compromise coronavirus relief package before he takes office, and noted that a handful of Republican senators have reached out to congratulate him, despite many not publicly acknowledging his victory. Both Biden and Harris also reemphasized their transition's commitment to a diverse Cabinet as a range of advocacy groups and lawmakers have begun pushing them to honor their pledge.
But, much like the campaign that vaulted them to the White House, it was the coronavirus that commanded the conversation.
Biden said that where he has authority, like in federal buildings or in interstate transportation on airplanes and buses, he will issue a standing order that masks must be worn. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says masks can help protect both the people wearing them and those around them from transmitting the virus. 
Biden and Trump have long taken diametrically different approaches to the virus, an issue that came to define the presidential election. Trump has fought many of the coronavirus recommendations laid out by his own administration, including mask wearing, while Biden strenuously followed coronavirus guidelines during the campaign.
Trump's fight against coronavirus recommendations often put him at odds with Fauci, one of the most outspoken members of the President's task force. Those clashes have made Fauci the focus of public attention, often seen as a hero on the left for his commitment to science in the face of Trump's comments and a villain on the right, especially among Trump loyalists.
Biden described his coronavirus plans as a balance between ensuring that Americans believe the vaccine is safe and instituting a number of plans that will curb the spread of the virus without shutting down the economy. 
Biden also said during the interview that he will be "happy to" get a coronavirus vaccine once Fauci says it is safe and that he will get the injection publicly to demonstrate his confidence in it. Harris also said she would get the vaccine.
"That's the moment in which I will stand before the public" and get the vaccine, Biden said. "People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work. Already the numbers are really staggeringly low, and it matters what the president and vice president do."
Biden's comments come a day after three of his presidential predecessors -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- said they would publicly get the coronavirus vaccine as a way to demonstrate its safety and efficacy.
"I think that my three predecessors have set the model as to what should be done, saying, once it's declared to be safe ... then obviously we take it and it's important to communicate to the American people," Biden said.
Backs compromise stimulus package
The former vice president also backed the compromise coronavirus relief package that is being considered on Capitol Hill, calling it a "good start" but also saying it is "not enough." The $908 billion bipartisan plan is a compromise between what Democrats and Republicans wanted.
"I think it should be passed, and I think that, in fact, we're going to need more," Biden said. "I'm going to have to ask for more help."
The transition from Trump to Biden has been a complicated affair, largely defined by the President's denial of the election results, something that most Republicans on Capitol Hill have indulged despite Trump's team failing to provide any credible evidence to back up the claim.
Biden, a Democrat who has long enjoyed strong relationships with Republicans in the Senate after serving for decades in the legislative body, said that despite their public silence, "several sitting Republican senators" have privately called to congratulate him.
He gave those senators some leeway for their silence.
"I understand the situation they find themselves in. And until the election is clearly decided in the minds when the Electoral College votes, they get put in a very tough position," Biden said, adding that he thinks once the Electoral College officially decides the election, a "significant portion of the (Republican) leadership" will acknowledge the obvious.
Biden laughed at a question about whether it is important for Trump to attend his presidential inauguration in January. Biden said whether to attend was Trump's decision and had "no personal consequence to me," but added that it did matter symbolically. 
It's "important in the sense that we are able to demonstrate the end of this chaos that he's created, that there is peaceful transfer of power with the competing parties standing there, shaking hands and moving on," Biden said. "What I worry about, Jake, more than the impact on the domestic politics, I really worry about the image we're presenting to the rest of the world."
On foreign policy, Biden said it was "hard to tell how much" the recent assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh would complicate his dealings with Tehran. A senior US administration official said this week that Israel was behind the assassination of the scientist, someone who had been an Israeli target for considerable time.
"The bottom line is that we can't allow Iran to get nuclear weapons," Biden said before slamming Trump's dealings with Iran, including his 2018 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. "He has pulled out to get something tougher, and what have they done? They've increased the ability for them to have nuclear material. They're moving closer to the ability to be able to have enough material for a nuclear weapon. And there's the missile issues."
Biden added: "All those things, I think, are going to be very difficult. But I know one thing: We cannot do this alone. And that's why we have to be part of a larger group, dealing not only with Iran, but with Russia, with China and a whole range of other issues."
Concern over potential pardons 
On his way out of office, Trump is expected to issue a number of pardons, with CNN reporting that he is considering preemptive pardons for his adult children and lawyer Rudy Giuliani, in addition to a possible preemptive pardon for himself.
Biden said the possible pardons concern him because of the "kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks (at) us as a nation of laws and justice," adding that his Justice Department will "operate independently on those issues" and how to respond to any Trump pardons.
"I'm not going to be telling them what they have to do and don't have to do," Biden said. "I'm not going to be saying, 'Go prosecute A, B or C.' I'm not going to be telling them. That's not the role. It's not my Justice Department, it's the people's Justice Department. So the persons or person I pick to run that department are going to be people who are going to have the independent capacity to decide who gets prosecuted, who doesn't."
Biden concluded that his administration would not approach pardons in the same way as Trump, adding, "It's going to be a totally different way in which we approach the justice system."
Biden has yet to select an attorney general and is considering a range of names, including former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates; Doug Jones, the soon-to-be former senator from Alabama who was defeated in November; and Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary under Obama.
Harris echoed the sentiment of Biden's remarks on the Department of Justice.
"We will not tell the Justice Department how to do its job," Harris said. "And we are going to assume, and I say this as a former attorney general elected in California ... that any decision coming out of the Justice Department ... should be based on facts, it should be based on the law, it should not be influenced by politics, period."
Biden interjected: "And I guarantee you, that's how it will be run."
Biden says he will keep diverse Cabinet commitment
A diverse range of advocacy groups and Democratic organizations have been pushing the Biden transition team for weeks to keep its commitment to nominate a diverse slate of Cabinet secretaries, especially for the remaining top jobs of secretary of defense and attorney general. The effort has been led by the NAACP, a group Biden and Harris said they would meet with next week, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
Biden said Thursday that he would honor the commitment.
"I'm going to keep my commitment that the administration, both in the White House and outside in the Cabinet, is going to look like the country," Biden said.
When pressed on both the racial and ideological diversity, Harris said, "We're not done yet. ... We're not even halfway there."
Biden said he understands that groups like the NAACP and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus want to "push me" on the diversity commitment, adding that his job is "to keep my commitment."
There were a host of lighter moments in the interview, too.
Biden laughed off the hairline fracture in his foot that has landed him in a walking boot, recalling how it happened when he was playing with his dog Major.
"The little pup dropped the ball in front of me for me to grab the ball ... and I grabbed the ball like this, and he ran, and I was joking running after him to grab his tail. And what happened was that he slid on a throw rug, and I tripped on the rug he slid on. That's what happened," Biden said with a smile. "Not a very exciting story."
Harris, for her part, joked about how some of her husband's friends have taken to calling him "the second dude," even as Doug Emhoff is expected to be referred to as the "second gentleman."
"You'll call him the second gentleman," Tapper asked.
"No," Harris responded: "I'll call him honey."

Biden says multiple Republican senators have called to congratulate him on election win
Updated 11:21 PM ET, Thu December 3, 2020
Washington  (CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden revealed Thursday that "more than several" Republican senators have called to privately congratulate him on his election win, despite the fact that most of them have not publicly acknowledged his victory last month.
Speaking alongside Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to CNN's Jake Tapper during their first joint interview since the election, Biden was asked how he can be optimistic about working with the Senate, which is currently controlled by Republicans. 
"I say this tactfully," Biden said. "There have been more than several sitting Republican senators who've privately called me and congratulated me."
"And I understand the situation they find themselves in. And until the election is clearly decided in the minds -- where the Electoral College votes, they get put in a very tough position," he added. 
Asked if he thinks more GOP senators will publicly recognize his win after the Electoral College votes on December 14, Biden replied: "At least a significant portion of the leadership." 
Biden, who served in the Senate for decades before being elected vice president in 2008, said he doesn't know if that will change across the board, noting that many of the senators he served with are no longer in office. 
"It's not the same Senate personnel that I knew when I left the Senate. There are only about 35 -- or 30%, 40% that are there when I was in the Senate," he said. 
As President Donald Trump has continued to push baseless claims of voter fraud in the weeks following the election, the President's Republican allies have been largely silent on Biden's win. Chief among them is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said last month that Trump is within his rights to make his case in court. 
CNN previously reported that Democratic Sen. Chris Coons said some Republican senators had been privately asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf.
"They call me to say, you know, 'Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can't say that publicly yet,'" Coons told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day."

Harris on her working relationship with Biden: 'We are full partners in thisÂ process'
Updated 11:33 PM ET, Thu December 3, 2020
Washington  (CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris may have been fierce rivals in the Democratic primary, but now, as they prepare to take control of the White House, they say they are full partners who agree on how to approach the country's most pressing issues. 
"Look, there's not a singleÂ decision I've made yet aboutÂ personnel or about how toÂ proceed that I haven't discussedÂ it with Kamala first," Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday.  
"That's true," Harris responded with a smile and nod in the duo's first joint interview since being elected. 
Biden and Harris had a memorably tense exchange at a 2019 primary debate when she confronted him over his decades-old fight againstÂ busingÂ to desegregate schools. She delivered a pointed attack that drew from her own experience with busing, which caught Biden visibly off guard and put him on the defensive. 
But all seemed forgiven when Biden clinched the Democratic nomination last spring and time came to choose a running mate. With Biden's selection of Harris, the senator from California would make history as the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to be elected vice president.   
"First of all, I understand howÂ campaigns can sometimes get aÂ little out of whack a littleÂ bit.Â And as I told her, you know, because youÂ asked the question, I don't holdÂ grudges," Biden said, dismissing any notion there is lingering tension from the primary campaign. 
The President-elect told Tapper there hadn't been any surprises working together "because we had theÂ discussion about thisÂ beforehand." He said he and Harris had discussed at length their views onÂ foreign policy, on domesticÂ policy and on intelligence, and he praised her experience working on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Biden said he and Harris are "simpatico on our philosophy ofÂ government and simpatico on howÂ we want to approach these issuesÂ that we're facing." He said that just as when he and President Barack Obama had disagreed, he and Harris speak about their disagreements in private. 
Harris said she and Biden have an understanding that before any big decision is made, she will be the last person in the room to speak to him. Biden often talks about the same understanding he had with Obama. 
"We are full partners in this process. And I will tell you that theÂ President-elect has been, since the first day he asked meÂ to join him on the ticket, beenÂ very clear with me that he wants me to be the firstÂ and the last in the room.Â And so on every issue that impactsÂ the American people I will be aÂ full partner to theÂ President-elect and theÂ President, and whatever our priorities are I will be thereÂ to support him and support the American people," Harris said. 
Biden spoke about the range of pressing issues his administration is gearing up to tackle on day one, and described a working partnership with Harris where responsibilities will be shared. 
"Whatever the most urgent needsÂ is that I'm not able to attendÂ to, I have confidence of being turningÂ to her," Biden said of Harris. 
He continued, "It wasn't that Barack said, 'Well,Â you know, Joe, we're going toÂ have a stimulus and I want youÂ to handle it.'Â It was, 'We've got to get thisÂ stimulus passed, I'm working onÂ this.Â Look, Joe, you take it.Â OK?Â This is what I want you to do.' "

'No fake news:' Biden and Harris sit down for a 'very normal' interview with Jake Tapper
Updated 12:21 PM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
New York  (CNN Business) - A version of this article first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.
In the final minute of Jake Tapper's sit-down with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on Thursday, Harris put it all in perspective:
"There couldn't be a more extreme exercise in stark contrast between the current occupant of the White House and the next occupant of the White House. And I do believe our country's going to be the better for the outcome of this election, and the election of Joe Biden as president."
The "stark contrast" is even more evident when Biden and Harris speak with the press. Thursday represented the pair's first joint interview, and CNN aired it as a prime time special at 9pm ET. 
"No fake news"
Right after the interview, Tapper talked with 10pm host Don Lemon, who said "it feels like we are watching ... a president-elect and a president who are on Earth One and Earth Two. And at this particular Earth that is in reality, it was very normal, very sedate. And it was welcoming news. It was good to watch. It was good to actually get content. We heard no fake news. We heard no conspiracy theories. We heard no personal grievances. We heard a President-Elect and a vice president who want to work with the other side."
"No fake news:" That's the yardstick now, since Trump routinely lies to his interviewers, even his super-fans like Maria Bartiromo.
Tapper told Lemon that a Biden interview is notably different than a Trump interview: With Biden, he said, "you don't have to really steel yourself for the potential reaction when you bring up uncomfortable subjects," as when Tapper asked about Biden's family members, and about areas of disagreement between Biden and Harris.
"There just wasn't the, you know, attack that we in the fourth estate have been used to. So that was unusual."
Biden says Trump should put America First
Toward the end of the interview, Tapper said, "President Trump has not said whether he's going to attend your inauguration yet. Do you think it's important that he's there?" Tapper pointed out that Biden chuckled during the question.
"I think it would -- important only in one sense, not in a personal sense," Biden said. "Important in the sense that we are able to demonstrate the end of this chaos that he's created, that there is peaceful transfer of power with the competing parties standing there, shaking hands, and moving on. I think that's important."
In other words, Biden thinks it's important for America. He thinks Trump should put "America First." Right? 
Five notable quotes 
-- In light of the multiple crises Biden is inheriting, Tapper asked, "what does it feel like... what's the emotion that goes through you?" The first words out of Biden's mouth were "I'm determined." 
-- Regarding the Covid-19 crisis, Biden said he will ask Americans to wear masks for "one hundred days."
-- Harris on her working relationship with Biden: "We are full partners in this process."
-- Biden said Americans will not see "policy by tweets" once he takes office.
-- Biden said he is reaching out, "not just to the communities that supported me, I'm going to reach out to those who didn't support me. I mean, for real, because I think a lot of people are just scared and think they've been left behind and forgotten. We're not going to forget anybody in this effort." That gets back to the "stark contrast" Harris described.

Biden's Cabinet conundrum deepens amid criticism over diversity
Updated 1:01 AM ET, Sat December 5, 2020
(CNN) - Joe Biden renewed his promise this week to build an administration that will "look like the country." But that task is proving to be a major challenge for the President-elect as he tries to achieve the right ideological balance and avoid alienating key allies -- while some Black and Latino leaders voice disappointment about the diversity of his choices so far.  
"You're going to see significant diversity," Biden told reporters at a press conference Friday after a week in which leaders of the NAACP and other civil rights groups signaled they are displeased that Biden hasn't named more Black Americans to high-profile positions.
Meanwhile, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ramped up the pressure by airing their frustrations about Biden team's handling of discussions with New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who they want to see as his nominee for health and human services secretary, and put forward specific names they want for attorney general.
But Biden refused to be boxed in Friday when asked whether he would nominate a person of color to fill the posts of attorney general or secretary of defense, the remaining two of the four premier Cabinet positions -- after he named a White man and a White woman to serve head the State Department and Treasury.
"I'm not going to tell you now exactly what I'm doing in any department, but I promise you, it'll be the single most diverse cabinet, based on race, color, based on gender, that's ever existed in the United States of America," the President-elect said.   
A day earlier he revealed during an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that he plans to meet with the board of the NAACP early next week, to make it clear he's listening to these myriad concerns as he plays a complex game of chess. 
Still, the process has pointed to two universal truths: it's going to be hard to please everyone and, for Biden, trying to bridge the fractious divides of the Democratic Party may end up being a zero-sum game. 
Pressure ramped up after Biden started filling posts
The pressures converging on Biden began to surface last month when he announced some members of his national security team, but notably held off on naming his defense secretary and CIA director. 
Multiple people familiar with transition discussions said that the deliberations about some of the yet-to-be-announced positions are being shaped by discussions -- and intense lobbying -- on the question of racial diversity in the new administration. 
Veteran Pentagon official MichÃ¨le Flournoy, for example, was once seen as a lock for defense secretary, but her prospects are now in limbo, in part because of the concerns over diversity.
"They're absolutely not going to have the top four Cabinet positions be white," one person familiar with transition discussions said -- a reference to the four key Cabinet positions of secretary of state, treasury secretary, defense secretary and attorney general. 
There was the perception of a domino effect of sorts after Biden named Tony Blinken as his secretary of state, sources said. Before Election Day, some Democrats speculated that Susan Rice, Obama's former national security adviser, who is Black, could get that role, but she would have faced steep headwinds during the Senate confirmation process if that body remains under Republican control. 
When the job ultimately went to Blinken -- followed by the Treasury role being given to Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve -- both private and public pressure increased for the Biden team to ensure that there are non-white individuals named to the remaining top roles like defense secretary, attorney general and health and human services secretary. 
In another example, Biden is interested in naming Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who lost his seat in November, as a contender to be his attorney general, but that's now also complicated by the fact that both Blinken and Yellen are White. 
Even Biden's historic selection of Harris, who will be the first Black and first female vice president, has added a wrinkle to the process. California Gov. Gavin Newsom must name her replacement and some of the top figures under consideration, California's Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Rep. Karen Bass, are also in contention for Biden Cabinet posts.
CNN reported Friday that Becerra is now emerging as a "contender of interest" to serve as Biden's HHS secretary, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
Incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier Friday that the transition team soon plans to announce key members of the President-elect's health team.
"You will be hearing more about the President-elect and the vice president-elect's team early next week and about their health team early next week -- and I would also just reiterate that there will be more to come after that," Psaki said.
After a heated election, key groups want to see their voices reflected
As he selects his team, Biden is facing the legacy of years of internecine battles within the Democratic Party, most notably the rift between progressives and centrists that helped Donald Trump win in 2016. Biden clinched the presidency in November in large part because the diverse coalitions within the Democratic Party united behind him. Now each of them wants to see their due.  
Black voters, and particularly Black women, showed their political power by lifting Biden to victory in the South Carolina primary and later in states like Georgia, building on years of work organizing, invigorating and mobilizing like-minded voters to cast ballots.
Latinos helped the former vice president win in states like Arizona and Nevada -- but Trump's surprising strength within that demographic group, according to exit polls, demonstrated that Biden has a great deal of work to do if he wants to show he can represent their interests in his administration, and nominating prominent Latinos and Latinas to key positions will be one part of that.
Meanwhile, progressives, who set aside their ideological differences with Biden to furiously organize and turn out big numbers of young and infrequent voters, are now demanding that their voices be reflected in his administration.  
They are exerting their influence as Biden's pick takes shape. When asked about the possibility that former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could run the Transportation Department, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told CNN: "That's a hard no." 
The progressive star of the 2018 freshman class said she understands why the Biden team has been cautious in some of their picks so far -- because GOP control of the Senate makes the confirmation process more difficult -- but she urged the Biden team to adopt a more aggressive strategy if Democrats sweep the Georgia Senate runoff.
The bar to meet both the ideological and diversity goals is high. And Biden's concerns about plucking too many Democratic members from the House -- now that his party has a more narrow majority -- have complicated the conundrum as he looks to the huge governing hurdles ahead. 
House majority whip and Democratic South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, who was critical to Biden's comeback on the shoulders of black voters during the primaries, told CNN Wednesday night he "can think of at least 10 Black folks that qualify for every single" Cabinet post. 
Earlier this week, leaders from seven Black-led civil rights groups said they had asked for a meeting with Biden's team to discuss the need for more Black nominees to his Cabinet. The groups also want to make sure the new administration is focused on ensuring appropriate representation on key minority and civil rights issues after a year when Americans took to the streets to protest systematic racism and police brutality directed toward Black Americans after the death of George Floyd. 
During their tense meeting with Biden transition officials this week, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus pushed specific names for top posts. In addition to asking Biden to name Lujan Grisham as HHS secretary, they said they want to see Becerra or Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez as attorney general.
So far Biden has named four people of color to his Cabinet. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a longtime diplomat who is Black, is Biden's nominee to be UN ambassador. Biden plans to nominate Alejandro Mayorkas, a Cuban American, to be secretary of Homeland Security, making him the first Latino in that position if confirmed by the Senate. The President-elect has also nominated Neera Tanden, who is South Asian, to head the Office of Management and Budget, and Cecilia Rouse to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, which he plans to elevate to Cabinet level.
During Biden and Harris' first joint interview this week with CNN, Harris could not name the leading progressive voice in the Cabinet thus far, but she hinted at the picks to come. 
"We're not done yet, Jake," the vice president-elect said. "We're not even halfway there. So, I think that we should have this conversation when we're done."

How Joe Biden's past could shape Kamala Harris' future as vice president
Updated 9:20 PM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
Editor's Note: Kate Andersen Brower is the author of the New York Times bestsellers "First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies" and "The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House." This reporting comes in part from her book, "First in Line: Presidents, Vice Presidents and the Pursuit of Power." Her latest book, "Exploring the White House: Inside America's Most Famous Home," is for children and will be published December 8. Unless otherwise noted, facts in this piece reflect research from her work. The opinions expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.com.
(CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden knows the challenges and the opportunities of the vice presidency better than any incoming president since George H.W. Bush. 
Biden has said that any power a vice president has is purely "reflective," meaning it is the president who decides how much influence his second-in-command wields. Now approaching his inauguration to the presidency, Biden seems to understand how critically important it is for him to share as much of his reflected light with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as possible. As our country faces a crippling pandemic, ongoing racial injustice and deep mistrust of government, we need all the light we can get.
If anyone would be open to sharing power and influence, it would be Biden, who served for eight years as vice president to Barack Obama â a leader who recognized that there are real risks in ignoring or mistreating your vice president. 
"Number one, that person's being underutilized," Obama says in "President In Waiting," a CNN Films documentary on the vice presidency. "Enormous talent that is not being tapped because there's a lack of trust. Another thing is, mischief arises if you've got somebody who's sitting down the hall in the West Wing who feels as if he is not being treated with respect and consulted on big decisions."
The vice president's tightrope
It's true that no office in the federal government has been pilloried more than the vice presidency. This derision did not begin with Julia Louis-Dreyfus' portrayal of the hapless Selina Meyer in HBO's "Veep." It came from the vice presidents themselves.
Thomas R. Marshall, vice president under Woodrow Wilson, joked, "Once there were two brothers: One ran away to sea, the other was elected vice president. Nothing was ever heard from either of them again." And according to John Nance Garner, who was vice president for Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1941, "The vice presidency is not worth a bucket of warm piss" (a famous quote later cleaned up to say "warm spit").
Every former vice president has had to walk a tightrope, constantly deciding when to fall in line and when to push back on the president. As the country's first female vice president and the first person of color to serve in the role, Harris will have to navigate these treacherous waters in a country that has not been this divided since the Civil War. 
A deep history of racism and sexism has been fueled by President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric. When Harris ended her presidential campaign late last year, he unsurprisingly seized on her exit to make fun of her: "Too bad. We will miss you Kamala!" To which she replied: "Don't worry, Mr. President. I'll see you at your trial."
When the vice president is a political superstar
Where other men â and they've all been men â may have felt maligned as vice president, there's no doubt Harris will command respect in the Biden White House. She's not new to firsts, having held roles in institutions not known for their progress on gender or racial politics. In 2017, she became the second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in US history. She served two terms as the district attorney of San Francisco, and was elected as the first African-American and first woman to serve as California's attorney general.
She's proven that she is uniquely well-suited to the role most vice presidents have played as their president's top defender. During her debate with Vice President Mike Pence, she held her ground when he interrupted her multiple times, saying, "Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking â I'm speaking." It was a moment that launched a thousand memes, as well as fueling Maya Rudolph's already legendary impersonation of her on "Saturday Night Live."
As with Obama, Biden is once again working alongside a former US senator and groundbreaking politician whose star power surely eclipses his own. And Biden's experience with Obama will be key in helping him shape a productive relationship with Harris.
When I interviewed Biden for my book "First In Line," he told me that he initially turned down Obama's offer to serve as his vice president because he could not imagine working for anyone. It was his mother who eventually convinced him that he could not pass up the opportunity to serve the country's first Black president. Now, Biden says, "It turned out to be the best decision I ever made in my life."
We know that Obama and Biden agreed to five ground rules in a private written document. The two most important things Biden told Obama he needed were "'to be able to be completely level with you and argue with you if we disagree privately; and secondly, to be the last person in the room on every major decision.'" And he didn't mean that figuratively; he meant it literally, a tradition he's now putting in place with Harris. 
"The President-elect has been, since the first day he asked me to join him on the ticket, very clear with me that he wants me to be the first and the last in the room," Harris said in an interview with Jake Tapper Thursday.
Biden said he spent four to seven hours a day with the president, and he was in every major meeting at Obama's request. At 7:40 every morning, his senior staff would meet with Obama's senior staff to set the day's agenda. Harris has portrayed her arrangement with Biden similarly: "What I will do, which is what Joe wants me to do, is share my lived experience to any issue that we confront," she said in a "60 Minutes" interview last month. That means bringing the perspective of one who has been "a Black child in America, who was also a prosecutor, who also has a mother who arrived here at the age of 19 from India."
Harris will likely take on the role of being an ambassador to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, having shown her ability to go toe-to-toe with Republicans. During the vice presidential debate, she accused the Trump administration of hiding what they knew about the pandemic. 
She will likely use her experience as a woman of color to voice deep concerns about racial injustice. Harris' parents were active in the civil rights movement and she has called the Black Lives Matter movement "an inflection point in the ongoing fight for justice" and "the most significant agent for change within the criminal justice system."
And with vice presidents often serving as debate facilitators in the White House, former prosecutor Harris will be well-suited to the task. The key to executing it, as Biden well knows, will be shrewdly managing the optics.
When Obama came into office, he began a review of the war in Afghanistan, which started in 2001. In 2009, there were 36,000 US troops in the country and 32,000 NATO forces. He came to rely on Biden to play the "bad cop" to his "good cop" during talks with generals who pushed for more troops than Biden thought was necessary.
"(Biden's) a master at asking questions in a way that you think you know which way he's leaning and then you realize you don't," said Antony Blinken, who was a foreign policy adviser to both Biden and Obama and who Biden has named secretary of state in his administration. "Biden was his guy -- pushing, prodding, challenging. By the last month of the review it was very much a deliberate thing."
Biden ultimately lost the argument. Before the review was even completed in December 2010, Obama accepted the Pentagon's recommendation to send more troops to Afghanistan. Yet the strategy of Biden often playing the devil's advocate during those meetings enabled Obama to stay above the fray.
Calculating the optics
A good vice president knows the difference between strategically challenging the president and his advisers and dissenting publicly with the president; it's a delicate balance that often requires the vice president falling on his -- or her -- own sword. If Biden disagreed with Obama, he would save it for private conversations, something he and Harris plan to continue.  
"It was not healthy for the president and the vice president to be seen even by the senior staff as having a disagreement," Biden said.
Biden, for instance, said he was unsure about the 2011 raid by Navy SEALs that killed Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader behind the 9/11 terror attacks who was hiding in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. "(Obama) knew his presidency was on the line with bin Laden," Biden said. "Think about if that had failed; his presidency would have come to practically a screeching end." Softened "against" to "unsure" since his story has evolved over time/gotten a little mushy on how tough a stance he took. 
On the night of April 28, Biden said Obama gathered top members of his national security team, including Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, CIA director Leon Panetta, Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Situation Room. Obama essentially did a roll call around the table, asking each whether they thought he should give the order to send the SEALs in. Biden came down against going in â without being absolutely sure that bin Laden was in the compound, Biden argued, more time was needed to get a positive identification. Most people were hedging their bets, Biden's recalled, saying they were "49/51" whether Obama should authorize the raid or not.
"I'm the last guy in the room and it comes to me," Biden said. "I turned to everybody and said ... Mr. President, I think you should choose option two (not to go)."
Later, Biden said, he had a private conversation with Obama and told him to follow his instincts. In the end, press reports made it seem like Biden was one of the lone voices against what ended up being a successful raid that won Obama widespread praise. "That's the job of the vice president," Biden said. "You're supposed to throw yourself in front of the train. That's one of the reasons I didn't want to do it (become vice president) in the beginning."
Like Biden, Harris will face weighty decisions and she will have to make the difficult calculation about how much she is willing to personally sacrifice to make Biden look good. This is especially vexing for someone who at 56 years old has a long political career ahead of her. At the same time, she knows that her legacy is tied to Biden's, so she will want him to succeed.
"There is only one person every four years who writes the job description for the vice presidency," said Pence in the CNN Films documentary. "And that's the president of the United States." 
I hope that Biden writes an expansive one for Harris.

Trump orders a near total withdrawal of US troops from Somalia
Updated 6:34 PM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
(CNN) - President Donald Trump has ordered the majority of US troops to leave Somalia "by early 2021," in just the latest major military policy decision being taken in the final days of the Trump administration. 
"The President of the United States has ordered the Department of Defense and the United States Africa Command to reposition the majority of personnel and assets out of Somalia by early 2021," the Pentagon said in a statement Friday.
The statement claimed that despite removing most of the roughly 700 troops currently serving in Somalia that "this action is not a change in US policy."
"This action is not a withdrawal and end to our efforts but a reposition to continue our efforts in East Africa," said a separate statement from United States Africa Command.  
Trump's order follows the November 17 announcement that he will withdraw thousands more US troops from Afghanistan and Iraq by January 15, 2021. 
Major changes
The Somalia announcement is Trump's most recent major change at the Pentagon, where he has jettisoned much of the civilian leadership in recent weeks, replacing officials with a slew of political loyalists as his administration winds to a close. Since firing Defense Secretary Mark Esper by tweet November 9, the President has ousted at least three other top officials and replaced them with perceived loyalists and targeted two advisory boards.
The President's directive on Somalia comes a week after the Pentagon inspector general that the terrorist threat in East Africa is not degraded and that Somali forces are not able to confront the threat without US support.
'Repositioned'
Some of the departing forces will leave the region, the Pentagon statement said, but many "will be repositioned from Somalia into neighboring countries in order to allow cross-border operations by both US and partner forces to maintain pressure against violent extremist organizations operating in Somalia."
The statement also said that "the US will retain the capability to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations in Somalia and collect early warnings and indicators regarding threats to the homeland."
The announcement comes about one week after acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller made an unannounced visit to Somalia on November 27, the first by an American defense secretary.
US troops in Somalia primarily train and advise local Somali forces as they battle al Qaeda's largest affiliate, Al-Shabaab. 
The US military also carries out airstrikes against Al-Shabaab and the local ISIS affiliate in the country, killing a top Al-Shabaab leader in a targeted strike in September..
Al-Shabaab
Despite many years of sustained Somali, US, and international counterterrorism pressure, the terrorist threat in East Africa is not degraded: Al-Shabaab retains freedom of movement in many parts of southern Somalia and has demonstrated an ability and intent to attack outside of the country, including targeting US interests," the inspector general report said.
Miller has said that one of his primary objectives for the Defense Department is to finish the fight against al Qaeda, a mission made more challenging by the continued presence of Al-Shabaab, particularly with a reduced US military effort.
The report also said that the focus of the US military's training effort in Somalia, the Danab Brigade, a light infantry force that has spearheaded the fight against Al-Shabaab, currently consists of only 945 soldiers, well below its authorized strength of 3,000. Pulling US forces from Somalia is bound to make training that unit even more difficult if not impossible.
The Trump administration pledged to train the Danab army in 2017 during an international conference in London.
While Al-Shabaab has been driven from Somalia's major cities and towns, the group still has much influence in southern Somalia, carries out terrorist attacks in Mogadishu and commands some 5,000-10,000 fighters. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley acknowledged the threat posed by the terror group Wednesday, saying, "we recognize that Al-Shabaab in the lower Jubba River Valley is a threat. We know that it is an organized, capable terrorist organization, it is an extension of Al Qaeda just like ISIS was, that they do have some reach and they could if left unattended, conduct operations against not only US interests in the region but also against the homeland."
"So they require attention, so we are taking a hard look at a repositioning of the force to better enable us to conduct counterterrorist operation," he added.

Biden's popular vote margin over Trump tops 7 million
Updated 11:27 AM ET, Fri December 4, 2020
Washington  (CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden's margin over President Donald Trump in the nationwide popular vote is now more than 7 million votes and may continue to grow as several states continue counting votes. 
Biden's lead over Trump is the second largest since 2000, and is about two and a half times larger than Hillary Clinton's popular vote lead over Trump in 2016. 
As of Friday morning, Biden had won about 81.2 million votes, the most votes a candidate has won in US history, and Trump had won about 74.2 million. Trump's vote count makes him the second-highest vote earner in American history.
Despite Biden's decisive victory and the Trump administration starting the formal presidential transition process, the President has refused to concede the race and continues to make baseless claims about widespread voter fraud.  
Biden won 306 electoral votes, while Trump has 232. Two hundred and seventy electoral votes are needed to become president.
Americans voted by mail in record numbers this year to protect themselves from the coronavirus pandemic, and experts had warned that as a result, there would be a lengthy vote count that would likely not resolve until days or weeks after Election Day. 
A number of states have certified their election results, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Michigan. 
The certifications have dealt significant blows to the Trump campaign's futile attempt to overturn the election results. The campaign has mounted legal challenges that have failed to gain any traction, with many of the cases being dismissed by judges for lack of evidence. 
Despite Trump's refusal to concede, Biden has continued to build out his administration and has named several key nominees and appointees to top roles in his administration. 
On Tuesday, Biden introduced a diverse economic team, including Janet Yellen, who would be the first woman as Treasury secretary if confirmed by the Senate. Last week, Biden named several members of his foreign policy and national security teams, including Avril Haines, who would be the first woman to lead the US intelligence community if confirmed.
